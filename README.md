# MovieWatchlistProject

## Development:
This projectâ€™s development began during the summer after I finished my first year. By this point I had developed a strong foundation in programming after my studies, by this point I understood the key data structures concepts and file manipulation.

## Purpose:
I developed this project in response to a personal problem I had where I would forget the movies I wanted to watch, when I had the time to watch and so identifying this problem I thought about what I could realistically do- leading to a brief plan of action describing the functionality I wanted to include in the project and found it easy to put together over the course of a month.
